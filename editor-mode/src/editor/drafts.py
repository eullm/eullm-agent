"""Article drafts where every claim is tied to stored sources.

The model writes the article as a list of claims, each with the ids of the
items that support it; there is no free text outside claims. Before a draft
is saved it is checked:

- every claim cites at least one item, and only items given to the model;
- every number in a claim appears in one of its cited items;
- no claim copies a long run of words from a source (originality).

A draft that still fails after a retry is saved as `needs_review` with the
problems listed next to the claims, never silently published.
