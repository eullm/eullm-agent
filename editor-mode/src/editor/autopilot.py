"""Automatic newsroom: a site that writes and publishes by itself, inside
the brief, the directives and the guardrails its owner set.

Every hourly round, inside the site's hours, the best proposals that pass
the guardrails are accepted and go to an `auto` job: the draft is written
with the usual checks (every sentence sourced, numbers found in the
sources, nothing copied), it gets its cover, an AI editor-in-chief reads it
against the guardrails, and only then is it approved and sent to the
site's destination. Nobody reads it first, so it always carries the AI
label (AI Act, art. 50(4)). An article the editor-in-chief stops stays a
draft, with the reasons, for a person to look at. One switch stops all.
