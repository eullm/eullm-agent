"""Cover images for the articles.

The photos of the news an article comes from belong to their publishers and
are never reused. Each article gets an image of its own instead: the model
writes the prompt from the article (one short call, with the alternative
text in the article's language), an image model draws it, and the image is
kept here. The dashboard shows it on the draft; the sites get it at
publication (WordPress as the featured image, GitHub in the repository,
webhooks as a link), served by an unguessable token.

Two services: OpenRouter's image API (one key for many models, the default
openai/gpt-image-2 writes readable words) and Black Forest Labs' FLUX on its
EU endpoint. A key starting with sk-or- is OpenRouter's. Each site picks the
cover's style: "impact" (made to be clicked: one strong subject, natural
contrast, readable as a thumbnail, optionally a short headline drawn in) or
"editorial" (a calm news photograph). Both are photographs, never renders.

Without `EDITOR_IMAGES_API_KEY` nothing of this runs and drafts have no
image. Every image is recorded in the usage like a model call, with its cost.
