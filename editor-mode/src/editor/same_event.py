"""Other outlets' reports of the same event, in any language.

The check of the outlets (drafts.event_items) compares the words of the
titles: a news item told in Italian never met the same event told in
English by the BBC or the Guardian, and two English titles written
differently often missed each other too. On 2026-11-05 every one of 167
proposals counted one outlet, a trial against Meta and Google that was
everywhere included (Francesco: "le fonti sono troppo poche per poter
confrontare").

Here names and numbers, which do not change with the language, find the
reports that may tell the same event; one call to the model per round
says which really do (the same fact, not the same subject), and the
proposal keeps them in basis["same_event"]. Each proposal is checked
once (basis["event_checked"]).
